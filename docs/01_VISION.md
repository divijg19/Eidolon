## Eidolon — Design Intent & Non-Negotiables

This document defines **why Eidolon exists** and **what it refuses to become**.

It is the highest-authority document in this repository.  
If a feature, mechanic, or technical decision contradicts this file, that decision is incorrect—regardless of convenience, novelty, or popularity.

To be re-read whenever writing code or unsure.

## 1. What Eidolon Is

**Eidolon** is a **persistent world simulation** in which players exist as agents among other agents, operating under pressure from systems that do not prioritize them.

It is a role-playing game only in the sense that:
- the player inhabits a role in a world,
- the world responds,
- and consequences accumulate over time.

Narrative is not authored.  
Progression is not guaranteed.  
Destiny is not assigned.

Eidolon is about **what a player chooses to pursue**, not what the game presents for completion.

## 2. The Central Question

Most RPGs ask:

> *Who will you become?*

Eidolon asks:

> **What will you attempt to build, control, preserve, exploit, abandon, or destroy—  
> and what will it cost you?**

The game does not reward intent.  
It responds to action, delay, misjudgment, and commitment.

## 3. The World Comes First

The world of Arrhaknea:
- exists independently of the player,
- evolves in time,
- contains competing interests,
- and does not wait.

Players do not “activate” the world by arriving.  
They enter something already in motion.

This principle applies equally to:
- NPCs
- factions
- economies
- conflicts
- information flow

The world is not a stage.  
It is the system.

---

## 4. Agency Without Privilege

Players are **agents**, not exceptions.

They:
- obey the same time model,
- operate with incomplete information,
- are constrained by scarcity,
- and can fail quietly.

There is no mechanical obligation for the world to:
- recognize the player,
- revolve around them,
- or preserve their relevance.

Obscurity is a valid outcome.  
Withdrawal is a valid strategy.  
Waiting is an action.

---

## 5. No Prescribed Destiny

Eidolon explicitly rejects:
- main quests
- chosen-one narratives
- optimal endings
- moral alignment tracks

There is no “correct” path.

A player may pursue:
- wealth without power,
- power without legitimacy,
- influence without visibility,
- stability over expansion,
- or nothing at all.

The game does not rank these outcomes.  
It merely enforces their consequences.

---

## 6. Consequence Over Reward

Eidolon does not motivate through:
- loot treadmills
- XP curves
- escalating power fantasies

Instead, it relies on:
- pressure
- risk
- opportunity cost
- irreversible commitment

Progress is defined by **what continues to exist because of your actions**.

Loss is not failure.  
Reversibility is rare by design.

---

## 7. Subjective Reality

There is no global truth layer accessible to players or NPCs.

Information in Eidolon is:
- local
- delayed
- incomplete
- distorted
- biased

Memory is not a log—it is an interpretation.

False beliefs are valid until disproven.  
Rumors can move markets.  
Silence can be strategic.

Clarity is something players must work to obtain—and often cannot.

---

## 8. Multiplayer as Shared Fate, Not Scale

If multiple players exist in the same world, they do so under **shared causality**, not parallel instances.

Multiplayer is intended to:
- increase negotiation
- create friction
- force coordination or conflict
- slow decision-making when outcomes intersect

It is not intended to:
- speed up play
- dilute consequence
- normalize outcomes
- or create constant action

When players’ choices collide, the world may **wait**.

This waiting is not a failure state.  
It is the cost of shared destiny.

---

## 9. Generative AI Is Not Authority

AI exists to:
- reason
- interpret
- plan
- summarize
- express intent

AI does **not**:
- decide outcomes
- override systems
- invent resources
- bypass scarcity
- guarantee narrative coherence

The simulation is authoritative.  
AI is advisory.

Human unpredictability—player or NPC—is expected and preserved.

---

## 10. Friction Is Intentional

Eidolon does not optimize for:
- constant engagement
- immediate clarity
- rapid feedback
- uninterrupted momentum

Moments of:
- waiting
- uncertainty
- disagreement
- inaction

are deliberate parts of play.

If a mechanic removes friction without introducing pressure, it does not belong.

---

## 11. Design Non-Negotiables

The following principles must hold at all times:

- The world advances independently of player presence
- Actions accumulate consequences
- Time matters
- Information is imperfect
- AI is bounded
- Players are not privileged
- Multiplayer increases complexity, not comfort

Breaking any of these requires rewriting this document.

---

## 12. Final Statement

Eidolon is not about winning.

It is about:
- committing to a direction,
- navigating pressure,
- and living with what follows.

Arrhaknea offers no guarantees—only leverage, risk, and opportunity.

**What are you willing to pursue—  
and what are you willing to lose in the process?**

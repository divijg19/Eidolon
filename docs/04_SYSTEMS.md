## What Creates Pressure

This document defines the **deterministic systems** that generate pressure in `Eidolon`.

Systems are not flavor.  
They are the reason choices matter.

If agents are *who acts*, systems are *what resists them*.

---

## 1. Systems Philosophy

All systems in `Eidolon` must satisfy the following:

- Be **deterministic**
- Operate independently of player presence
- Introduce scarcity or trade-offs
- Create long-term consequences
- Interact with other systems

No system exists to:
- reward participation,
- guarantee balance,
- or ensure fairness.

Systems exist to **apply pressure**.

---

## 2. Economy System

### 2.1 Core Principles

The economy is:
- Supply and demand driven
- Regionally localized
- Sensitive to disruption
- Slow to stabilize

There are no fixed prices.

---

### 2.2 Goods and Resources

Resources include:
- Food
- Raw materials
- Manufactured goods
- Luxury goods
- Strategic resources

Each resource has:
- Production sources
- Consumption sinks
- Transport cost
- Storage constraints

Scarcity emerges naturally.

---

### 2.3 Trade and Transport

Trade requires:
- Physical movement
- Time
- Protection

Trade routes can be:
- disrupted
- monopolized
- taxed
- destroyed

Markets do not self-correct instantly.

---

### 2.4 Economic Collapse

Economic failure may result in:
- Starvation
- Unrest
- Migration
- Institutional breakdown

Collapse is systemic, not scripted.

---

## 3. Faction System

### 3.1 Faction Identity

Factions are agents with:
- Territory
- Ideology
- Power base
- Internal divisions

Factions are not unified minds.

---

### 3.2 Power and Legitimacy

Power is divided into:
- Hard power (force)
- Soft power (legitimacy, influence)

A faction may have one without the other.

Loss of legitimacy destabilizes control.

---

### 3.3 Internal Fracture

Factions can:
- Split
- Be infiltrated
- Collapse internally

Faction collapse is gradual and observable.

---

## 4. Combat System

### 4.1 Combat Philosophy

Combat is:
- Lethal
- Costly
- Visible
- Politically destabilizing

It is never casual.

---

### 4.2 Resolution Factors

Combat outcomes depend on:
- Numbers
- Preparation
- Morale
- Logistics
- Terrain
- Information quality

Heroics rarely overcome systems.

---

### 4.3 Consequences of Violence

Violence causes:
- Resource loss
- Reputation change
- Political reactions
- Retaliation

Every act of violence echoes outward.

---

## 5. Information System

### 5.1 Information Flow

Information:
- Travels through agents
- Degrades with distance and time
- Is distorted by bias

There is no global truth feed.

---

### 5.2 Rumors and Misinformation

False information:
- Can spread
- Can influence behavior
- May never be corrected

Truth competes with narrative.

---

## 6. Law and Enforcement

### 6.1 Local Authority

Law is:
- Regional
- Unevenly enforced
- Dependent on power

There is no universal justice.

---

### 6.2 Enforcement Capacity

Laws matter only if enforced.
Enforcement costs resources.

Selective enforcement creates resentment.

---

## 7. System Interaction

Systems do not operate in isolation.

Examples:
- Economic collapse fuels rebellion
- War disrupts trade
- Misinformation sparks conflict
- Legitimacy loss undermines enforcement

Most crises are multi-system failures.

---

## 8. Player Interaction with Systems

Players may:
- Exploit systems
- Stabilize systems
- Break systems
- Be crushed by systems

Systems do not adapt to player skill.
They adapt to player impact.

---

## 9. Failure Is Systemic

Failure in `Eidolon` is rarely personal.

It is usually:
- Misjudgment of pressure
- Overextension
- Delayed response
- Ignored signals

Systems fail gradually—until they don’t.

---

## 10. Design Guarantees

These systems guarantee that:
- Power has cost
- Stability is fragile
- Violence escalates
- Information matters
- Inaction has consequences

Any system that removes pressure is invalid.

---

## 11. Final Statement

`Eidolon` is not driven by story beats.

It is driven by:
- supply lines breaking,
- alliances weakening,
- trust eroding,
- and time advancing.

You do not overcome systems before you learn to **navigate them— or you are consumed by them**.

Say **continue** and we proceed.

## How the World Remembers

This document defines **how memory functions** in `Eidolon` and why memory—not truth—drives future action.

Memory is not a log.  
It is an interpretation shaped by emotion, bias, and decay.

If systems create pressure and agents choose under it, memory is what **binds past pressure to future behavior**.

---

## 1. Memory Philosophy

Memory in `Eidolon` is:
- Subjective
- Incomplete
- Emotionally weighted
- Persistently influential

Agents do not act on what happened.  
They act on what they **remember** happened.

---

## 2. Memory Types

`Eidolon` distinguishes between two core memory types.

---

### 2.1 Event Memory (Canonical)

Event memory represents **objective facts**.

Properties:
- Immutable
- System-generated
- Chronologically ordered
- Stored persistently

Examples:
- “Treaty X was signed at tick 1823”
- “Agent Y died in combat”

Event memory is not directly accessible to agents in full.

---

### 2.2 Narrative Memory (Subjective)

Narrative memory represents **experienced interpretation**.

Properties:
- Agent-specific
- Emotionally tagged
- Summarized
- Stored as semantic representations

Examples:
- “I was betrayed during the grain shortage”
- “The council humiliated me publicly”

Narrative memory is what agents reason with.

---

## 3. Memory Formation

### 3.1 Event Ingestion

After each tick:
- Relevant events are selected per agent
- Events are filtered by perspective
- Visibility is determined by location and access

Agents do not see everything.

---

### 3.2 Interpretation

Agents interpret events through:
- Existing beliefs
- Emotional state
- Relationships
- Prior memories

The same event can produce different memories.

---

### 3.3 Summarization

Raw experiences are periodically summarized into:
- Long-term narrative memory
- Emotional impressions
- Belief reinforcements

Summarization reduces detail but preserves meaning.

---

## 4. Emotional Weighting

Each narrative memory carries:
- Valence (positive / negative)
- Intensity
- Relevance to current goals

Emotion affects:
- Recall likelihood
- Belief rigidity
- Decision urgency

Highly emotional memories decay more slowly.

---

## 5. Memory Decay

### 5.1 Decay Mechanics

Over time:
- Detail fades
- Precision is lost
- Confidence may increase falsely

Decay is:
- Gradual
- Non-linear
- Emotion-dependent

Agents may become more certain of incorrect memories.

---

### 5.2 Forgetting

Forgetting is:
- Normal
- Uneven
- Often incomplete

Forgetting does not erase consequences.
It only alters perception.

---

## 6. False Memory and Misinformation

### 6.1 False Beliefs

Agents may:
- Remember events that did not occur
- Misattribute causes
- Conflate multiple events

False beliefs are valid until challenged.

---

### 6.2 Correction

Beliefs may be corrected through:
- Contradictory evidence
- Trusted testimony
- Repeated exposure

Correction is slow and uncertain.

---

## 7. Relationship Memory

Agents maintain memory **about others**, not just events.

Includes:
- Past cooperation
- Betrayals
- Debts
- Humiliation
- Gratitude

Relationship memory strongly biases future interaction.

---

## 8. Player Memory

### 8.1 Player Knowledge

Players have:
- Their own memory
- UI-accessible logs
- Private notes

The game does not enforce player forgetting.

---

### 8.2 Player–NPC Asymmetry

NPCs may:
- Forget details the player remembers
- Remember emotions the player dismisses
- Act on misinterpretations

This asymmetry is intentional.

---

## 9. Memory as a Strategic Layer

Players may:
- Manipulate memory through narrative
- Spread misinformation
- Erase evidence
- Reinforce reputations

Winning an argument can matter more than winning a battle.

---

## 10. Persistence and Inheritance

When an agent dies:
- Their memories do not vanish
- Stories persist through others
- Emotional residue affects successors

History is social, not archival.

---

## 11. Design Guarantees

This memory system guarantees:
- No omniscient actors
- Persistent bias
- Long-term grudges
- Rumor-driven dynamics
- Subjective history

Perfect recall would break `Eidolon`.

---

## 12. Final Statement

*Arrhaknea* does not remember what truly happened.

It remembers:
- what was felt,
- what was believed,
- and what was repeated.

You may change the world.

But you will never fully control  
**how it remembers you.**

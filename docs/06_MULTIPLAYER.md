## Shared Fate Mode

This document defines how **multiple players coexist in a single world instance** without weakening consequence, agency, or pressure.

Multiplayer in `Eidolon` is not about scale or speed.  
It is about **shared causality**.

If single-player is a negotiation with the world, multiplayer is a negotiation **with other people inside that world**.

---

## 1. Multiplayer Philosophy

Multiplayer exists to:
- Increase friction
- Force coordination or conflict
- Slow decision-making when outcomes intersect
- Externalize deliberation (discussion, debate, bargaining)

Multiplayer does **not** exist to:
- Accelerate progression
- Normalize outcomes
- Guarantee fairness
- Enable parallel, consequence-free play

Shared play increases responsibility.

---

## 2. One World, Many Players

### 2.1 World Authority

All players inhabit:
- One authoritative world instance
- One global clock
- One event history

There are no shards, mirrors, or per-player timelines.

Players are agents within the same simulation.

---

### 2.2 Player Independence

Each player:
- Has their own character
- Holds private information
- Pursues private goals
- Operates through a local client

Shared world does not imply shared intent.

---

## 3. Time Model in Multiplayer

### 3.1 Synchronous World Time

- World time advances globally
- All players experience the same tick count
- Systems update uniformly

Players cannot desynchronize time.

---

### 3.2 Asynchronous Agency

Players may:
- Act at different moments
- Wait while others act
- Be absent while the world progresses

Asynchronous play is permitted until causality intersects.

---

## 4. Causal Locks (Timegating)

### 4.1 Definition

A **Causal Lock** is triggered when an action:
- Irreversibly alters shared state
- Directly affects another player’s viable futures

Examples:
- War declarations
- Assassinations of shared NPCs
- Binding treaties
- Economic collapse triggers
- Territory seizure impacting others

---

### 4.2 Lock Behavior

When a causal lock activates:
- The world clock pauses
- Affected players are notified
- Further irreversible actions are blocked

The world waits.

---

### 4.3 Resolution

Causal locks resolve when:
- All affected players acknowledge the action
- A counter-action is submitted
- A deadline expires (system-defined)

Once resolved:
- The action commits
- Consequences propagate
- Time resumes

Waiting has cost.

---

## 5. Negotiation and External Deliberation

The game explicitly expects players to:
- Discuss choices outside the client
- Argue, bargain, threaten, or promise
- Coordinate timing and intent

The game enforces outcomes, not agreement.

The world does not care how consensus is reached.

---

## 6. Parties

### 6.1 Party Definition

A party is:
- A voluntary association
- Non-binding
- Revocable at any time

Parties exist to:
- Share actions
- Coordinate movement
- Pool resources temporarily

---

### 6.2 Party Limitations

Parties do not:
- Merge inventories permanently
- Share memory automatically
- Prevent betrayal

Trust is social, not mechanical.

---

## 7. Conflict Between Players

Player conflict is allowed.

This includes:
- Economic sabotage
- Political maneuvering
- Violence
- Misinformation

The system does not:
- Mediate fairness
- Protect weaker players
- Resolve moral disputes

Only rules and consequences apply.

---

## 8. Absence and Persistence

### 8.1 Player Absence

If a player is absent:
- The world continues
- NPCs and players act
- Their interests may suffer

Absence is not neutral.

---

### 8.2 Rejoining

Rejoining players:
- Receive updated perspective
- Discover consequences retroactively
- May find their plans invalidated

The world does not pause for return.

---

## 9. Multiplayer Failure States

Multiplayer does not end because:
- Players disagree
- One player dominates
- A party dissolves

It ends only if:
- The world collapses
- All players are removed
- The instance is terminated

Social breakdown is valid play.

---

## 10. Design Guarantees

Shared Fate Mode guarantees:
- No parallel realities
- No hidden rewinds
- No vote-based safety
- No frictionless cooperation

If multiplayer reduces consequence, it is incorrect.

---

## 11. Final Statement

`Eidolon` multiplayer is not about playing together.

It is about **living together in a world that does not bend**.

When destinies intersect,  
the world waits—  
and the cost of waiting belongs to everyone.

Say **continue** and we proceed.

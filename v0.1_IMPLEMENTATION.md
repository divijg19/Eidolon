## `Eidolon` v0.1 — Scope, Checklist, and Definition of Done

This document defines **exactly what v0.1 is**, what it includes, what it explicitly excludes, and when it can be considered complete.

v0.1 is not a demo.  
It is a **proof of world correctness**.

If v0.1 is solid, everything else can grow from it.  
If v0.1 is rushed or bloated, the project collapses later.

---

## 1. Purpose of v0.1

v0.1 exists to prove that:

- A deterministic world can advance in time
- Agents can act autonomously within systems
- Memory and consequence propagate correctly
- A player can exist without narrative scaffolding
- The game remains interesting **without content scale**

v0.1 is intentionally small.

---

## 2. High-Level Scope

### Included
- Single world instance
- Single town + immediate surroundings
- 5–10 NPC agents
- 1 player agent
- Core systems (minimal)
- Terminal-based interface
- Single-player only (multiplayer stubs allowed)

### Excluded
- Graphics beyond TUI
- Large maps
- Combat depth
- Multiple towns
- Multiplayer gameplay
- Balance tuning
- Content variety

If something is not required to prove **consequence**, it does not belong.

---

## 3. World Scope (*Arrhaknea* v0.1)

### 3.1 Geography
- One town
- Named districts or locations (5–8)
- Limited external trade connection
- No procedural expansion

The map is small but persistent.

---

### 3.2 Time
- Fixed tick duration (e.g. 1 hour)
- Automatic tick advancement
- Visible in UI
- No time acceleration controls

Time must be felt.

---

## 10. Terminal UI (TUI)

Checklist:

- [ ] Player inaction produces visible consequences

If these are not true, v0.1 is not done.

v0.1 must be:
- Correct

## 14. Final Reminder

v0.1 is not about fun.

It is about **truth**:
- truth of systems,
- truth of memory,
- truth of consequence.

Fun emerges later.
